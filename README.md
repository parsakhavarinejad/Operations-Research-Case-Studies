## üìå Description

This repository contains a collection of **Operations Research (OR) case studies** based on real-world applications.  
Each case study is presented in its own folder with:

- A detailed **README.md** explaining the problem and mathematical formulation.  
- A **Jupyter notebook** with implementations in Python.  
- Solutions using both **mathematical programming (Pyomo)** and **specialized combinatorial/heuristic approaches** when applicable.  
- Sample data files and scripts for experimentation.  

The case studies are drawn from *Katta G. Murty ‚Äì Optimization Models for Decision Making*.

## ‚úÖ Goals of the Repository

- Provide **hands-on Python implementations** of classic OR case studies.  
- Compare **exact optimization (Pyomo)** with **custom combinatorial/heuristic approaches**.  
- Serve as a **learning resource** for students, researchers, and practitioners in **Industrial Engineering, Operations Research, and Data Science**.
