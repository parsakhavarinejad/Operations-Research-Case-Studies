## 📌 Description

This repository contains a collection of **Operations Research (OR) case studies** based on real-world applications.  
Each case study is presented in its own folder with:

- A detailed **README.md** explaining the problem and mathematical formulation.  
- A **Jupyter notebook** with implementations in Python.  
- Solutions using both **mathematical programming (Pyomo)**, **specialized combinatorial/heuristic approaches**, Reinforcement Learning, and etc when applicable.  
- Sample data files and scripts for experimentation.

## 🗂️ Case Studies Included

1. **Container Terminal Congestion Reduction**  
   – Equalizing storage block fill-ratios to reduce truck congestion.  

2. **Inventory Optimization and Control Using Markov Decision Process**  
   – Implementing MDP in Reinforcement Learning using a case study in inventory control

3. **Marketing Optimization via RL - SARSA and Expected SARSA**
   – An RL-based control system implementing SARSA and Expected SARSA to derive profit-maximizing marketing policies in a stochastic environment.

## ✅ Goals of the Repository

- Provide **hands-on Python implementations** of classic OR case studies.  
- Compare **exact optimization (Pyomo)** with **custom combinatorial/heuristic approaches**.  
- Serve as a **learning resource** for students, researchers, and practitioners in **Industrial Engineering, Operations Research, and Data Science**.
